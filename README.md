Code for Autonomous Sensing Motion Robot (ASMR) project for ECE 428 - Embedded Systems. Originally created in Spring 2022 semester.

This program was created using the Arduino IDE. The library LiquidCrystal_I2C from GitHub was used to interface the I2C module with the LCD. The “Wire.h” library was also used in the code.
